## What it is

A distributed measurement system that learns what the Russian TSPU is doing per operator/region
in near-real-time and pushes signed "use this transport here" intelligence to circumvention
clients inside Russia, so the fleet heals from a new block within minutes. Core primitive:
measure the *delta* (what a sensor sent vs. what a server you control received); the *shape* of
the difference is a diagnosis, not pass/fail. The live-adversary sibling of the `dpi-bench`
differential technique.

## Repo

`github.com/Mezo-oz/Lokhotron` — public, MIT, docs-only so far (no code yet). Design settled;
first build target is Phase 1.

## Three-tree architecture (a security boundary, not tidiness)

1. `dpi-bench` (`X:\DPI-Tester`) — offline zapret2 harness, teaches the capture/diff primitive on
   a lab target. Exists.
2. **Lokhotron** (this repo) — the sensing layer: probe, reverse-measurement server, collector,
   control plane. Your infrastructure (Rust/Python/SQL on Linux VPSes). One workspace, multiple
   crates. **Build now.**
3. The **client** — ships to Android phones; kept in a *separate* tree so an adversary
   reverse-engineering the app can't extract the endpoint inventory, dark canaries, or
   control-plane logic. Credible home is **amnezia-client upstream**, not a repo we own (inherits
   its trust anchor). Design notes at `X:\Lokhotron-client\DISTRIBUTION.md`, deliberately outside
   the repo.

The only thing crossing the #1↔#2 boundary is a **versioned spec** ([CONTRACT.md](CONTRACT.md)),
not shared code: verdict vocabulary + k-anon telemetry schema (#2→#1) + signed weighted-mix
bundle format (#1→#2).

## Key design decisions locked in (corrections to the original concept)

- **Control plane is a targeting oracle** — signing stops forgery, not *disclosure*. Bundles
  carry a **weighted distribution over surviving transports that the client samples**, never an
  argmax (argmax = fleet monoculture = ideal monitoring target). Plus **dark endpoints** never
  named in any bundle, as the only detector for a Potemkin clean-path.
- **dpi-bench inheritance is narrow** — the reassembler does *not* transfer (the live server is a
  real endpoint). What transfers is the property-vocabulary method → the **verdict vocabulary**.
  Byte-diff only earns its keep on selective-drop / payload-mutation; its MVP is a
  **sequence-marked echo protocol**, not a diff engine.
- **DC-vs-consumer gap is the central constraint** — a cheap RU VPS may sit behind a different
  box or none, so its signal can be categorically wrong. This makes **client-as-sensor the
  unlock, not the capstone**, which forces the k-anon telemetry schema + edge-aggregation
  (collector can't de-anon even under coercion) to be specced day one.
- **Phase 0/1 inverted** — Phase 1 (one RU VPS + one non-RU VPS + probe battery, ~$10/mo weekend)
  is the thesis test and a net4people-publishable deliverable on its own. Phase 0 (OONI/Censored
  Planet ingest) shrinks to a ≤1-week context layer.

## Founding principle (non-negotiable, binds both trees)

> The client never runs on anyone who did not install it. Deniability is a capability given to an
> informed user, never a state of ignorance imposed on them.

No worm, no covert install. Android duress design = PanicKit (fork if needed) → crypto-erase
keys; recommend GrapheneOS duress PIN for the high-risk tier. Full rationale in
`X:\Lokhotron-client\DISTRIBUTION.md`.

## Phase status

| Phase | State |
|---|---|
| Design | **Done** — DESIGN + CONTRACT + this file committed. |
| Phase 0 (context ingest, ≤1 wk) | Not started. |
| Phase 1 (2 VPS + probe battery + echo delta) | **Next.** Not started. |
| Phase 2 (analysis + signed bundle push) | Not started. |
| Phase 3 (client-as-sensor fusion) | Not started. |

## Open before hardening (verify, don't trust from memory)

- TSPU's current DC-vs-consumer treatment — Phase 1 should confirm; the whole third correction
  rests on it.
- Current Russian legal exposure for running a sensor / recruiting volunteers.
- OONI + Censored Planet current API shapes before Phase 0 ingest.
- Concrete transport enum must track amnezia-client's real transport set, not this draft's guess.

## Next actions

1. Stand up Phase 1's two VPSes + the probe battery and echo server.
2. Decide sequencing: arguably finish `dpi-bench` Phase 1 first — it teaches the exact
   capture/diff primitive on a safe target before pointing it at the live adversary.
